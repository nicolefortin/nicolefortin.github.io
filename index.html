    <td>Hello there! I was born and raised in a small town in Maine. Tired of
      opening my door to 5 feet of fresh snow every few days, I ventured
      to New York City and have been living in Brooklyn for 6 years now.<br><br>

      I'm pretty resourceful and have a knack for figuring things out
      and coming up with solutions, and this lead me to be involved with startup
      operations for companies including <a href='http://www.upworthy.com'>Upworthy</a>,
      <a href='http://www.fab.com'>Fab</a>, and
      <a href='http://www.theladders.com'>TheLadders</a>.
      For anyone who has ever worked in operations at a startup,
      you'll know just how exhausting the workload can be! I've finally
      decided to embrace my visually creative side and move towards a career path
      that engulfs both my naturally artistic and business-savvy instincts.<br><br>

      A few fun facts: I'm a strong advocate for year-round pumpkin products;
      I'm addicted to ice lattes;
      I'll be the first person to tell you about a new bar/restaurant/store opening in the area;
      and I was voted most likely to become a teacher -- perhaps the most boring and
      complimentary superlative ever created.

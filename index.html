    <li>Hello there!<br>
      I was born and raised in Maine but have been living in Clinton Hill,
      Brooklyn for the past five years.<br>
      I've worked within operations at NYC startups including
      <a href='http://www.upworthy.com'>Upworthy</a>,
      <a href='http://www.fab.com'>Fab</a>, and
      <a href='http://www.theladders.com'TheLadders.</a>
        Working within this realm can be pretty exhausting! I've decided to continue
        my passion towards great design and products by pursuing a career
        in UX design and web development.
        In addition to design, I'm passionate about
        year-round pumpkin products, scouting out the best iced lattes at local
        cafes, and working with designers and small business owners on building
        their businesses.</li>

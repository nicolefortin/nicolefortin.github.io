1. http://framedandmatted.com/
Overall, customizable framing sites are pretty overwhelming, feel dated, and are expensive. Building a frame can be a frustrating experience after going through all of the steps and then discovering

    * Pros: Very clean, modern, inviting design experience. Relatively easy building experience.
    * Cons: Pricing isn't upfront while choosing frame styles.
        * "Shape" option is confusing until photos pop up. Rewording could give users more clarity.
        * In building phase, "Mats" scrollbar is annoying to operate.
2. http://www.allposters.com/services/frames/#
    * Pros: Pricing very upfront as you customize.
        * Can choose wall color when customizing.
    * Cons: Took me awhile to figure out where to navigate to to get the building process started
      * Site will only bring you to build page after selecting a poster to purchase.
      * Overall design & feel of site feels very dated
      * Overwhelming and makes me lose interest -- too much going on.
3. http://www.arttoframe.com/
    * Pros: Gives examples of what frame size would look like in a room during building process
    * Cons: Site design feels scammy and untrustworthy
        * Nav Bar (Standard frames, Collage frames, etc.) is very overwhelming; would prefer to be taken straight to building page instead of seeing all options available on the first page
        * Buttons during building process are cheesy
        * "Next" and "Previous" buttons while building are hidden; have to keep scrolling down on page
